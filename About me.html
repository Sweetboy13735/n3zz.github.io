                    My real name is Amritesh. I have the online aliases: Ary, n3zz, ary_yakos, tesh. I go by many names. 
                    I am an 18 year old computer science student aspiring to pursue a career in Cyber Security.
                    As you can see I have prior knowledge in Web Designing.
                    I have about 7+ years in coding experience. I am currently also learning Java, PHP and JavaScript to gain further knowledge in website development. I have also had some experience in Flask and Django.

                    In addition to programming, I have deep passion of video games and seeing what makes them tick. When I am not digging around in HackTheBox, I would look at making text based adventure game prototypes. I also code on games in working with my friends and the people in a small discord server that I run called The Pseudo Dopamine Centre.

                <section>
                    My first hand experience with cyber security is my main experience with Cyber Discovery and my own experience with Kali Linux and GNS and Cisco Packet Tracer. I also tried practical skills on legal hacking sites such as <a id="otw" href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/" target=blank>OverTheWire</a> and <a id="htb" href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/" target=blank>HackTheBox</a> I know all the basics it requires to make a network safe and secure as possible. Additionally I am also working on getting my Security+ and CEH.
