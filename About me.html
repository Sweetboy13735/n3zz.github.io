            <p>Hello, I am Ary!</p>

            <p id="bio">
            <section id="programmer">
                My real name is Amritesh. I have the online aliases: Ary, n3zz, ary_yakos, tesh. I go by many names. 
                I am an 18 year old computer science student aspiring to pursue a career in Cyber Security.
                As you can see I have prior knowledge in Web Designing.
                I am open to freelancing to small projects and assisting in HTML/CSS projects. I can also help with basic SQL databases.
                I have about 7+ years in coding experience. I am currently also learning Java, PHP and JavaScript to gain further knowledge in website development. I have also had some experience in Flask and Django.

                <p>In addition to programming I also play games fairly often. I mainly do Youtube content and stream on Twitch from time to time. I am a community manager and the founder of a Discord community: The Pseudo Dopamine Centre.
                The community is just a small place for like minded individuals who love to play games and or programming.</p>

                    My first hand experience with cyber security is my main experience with Cyber Discovery and my own experience with Kali Linux and GNS and Cisco Packet Tracer. I know all the basics it requires to make a network safe and secure as possible. 
                    For my higher education, I am going to study for my BSc for Computer Science or go straight to an MEng in Cyber Security.
