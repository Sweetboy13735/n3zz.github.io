# n3zz's Portfolio Website (Optimised copy by Sweetboy13735)
[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-v2.0%20adopted-ff69b4.svg)](https://github.com/Sweetboy13735/n3zz.github.io/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

So my mate [n3zz](https://github.com/n3zz) has his own portfolio website, however the code for it is... rather lack-luster, to say the least (Sorry chief). This project is a copy of his original work with some added optimisations and code improvements, which can be viewed [here](https://Sweetboy13735.github.io/n3zz.github.io).

## Support
If you encounter any issues on the website, please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/Sweetboy13735/n3zz.github.io/issues) (Provided it hasn't been logged already) or [E-mail me](mailto:ramonegraham@gmail.com), describing fully what the problem is.

## Roadmap
Throughout this project's development, I'll be using the "Ramone's_redo" branch to push my changes.

For the most part, this'll be a "one-and-done" project. However, if I do come up with any suggestions/ideas in the future, I'll be sure to track the changes for it in a new branch from master.

## [Contributing](https://github.com/Sweetboy13735/n3zz.github.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
Since this is an optimised copy of an existing page, I'm looking to do more of the heavy-lifting myself, but I am open to small contributions. Please check out the link above for more info.
